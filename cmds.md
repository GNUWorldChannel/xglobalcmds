NOTE:

    Parameters enclosed in <>'s are mandatory.
    Parameters enclosed in []'s are optional.
    x|y means x or y.
    <nick> refers to a person's IRC nickname that they are online with.
    <username> refers to a person's username as it appears in the userlist; not to be confused with <nick>. For more information about usernames and how to determine a person's username, refer to the VERIFY and INFO commands (level 0).
    All commands shown with the <username> field can also work by specifying a user's IRC nickname that they are online with by preceding their nickname with an equal (=) sign. For example, consider a person with the nickname ^[Test]^ and username Test. The ACCESS command can be performed on this user in either of these 2 methods:
        /msg X access <#channel> Test
        /msg X access <#channel> =^[Test]^

    The 1st method directly queries X as to whether or not the username "Test" is in the userlist. The 2nd method makes X lookup ^[Test]^'s username if they are authenticated, which refer's to their username of "Test". This can be performed with any command that requires a <username>, but will only work if the user is authenticated, otherwise a "No Match" reply or equivalent will be returned.
